            "[2700.88s -> 2703.60s]  I mean, it's not good because again, size is not everything,\n",
            "[2703.60s -> 2707.92s]  but also people just take a lot of these kinds of discussions out of context.\n",
            "[2708.80s -> 2712.16s]  But it is interesting to, I mean, that's what I was trying to do,\n",
            "[2713.12s -> 2718.72s]  to compare in different ways, the difference between the human brain and the neural network.\n",
            "[2718.72s -> 2721.28s]  And this thing is getting so impressive.\n",
            "[2721.28s -> 2725.84s]  This is like, in some sense, someone said to me this morning, actually,\n",
            "[2725.84s -> 2727.60s]  and I was like, oh, this might be right.\n",
            "[2727.60s -> 2731.04s]  This is the most complex software object humanity has yet produced.\n",
            "[2732.24s -> 2734.64s]  And it will be trivial in a couple of decades, right?\n",
            "[2734.64s -> 2736.72s]  It'll be like kind of anyone can do it, whatever.\n",
            "[2737.28s -> 2742.32s]  But yeah, the amount of complexity relative to anything we've done so far\n",

            "[2817.84s -> 2820.64s]  But I think what matters is getting the best performance.\n",
